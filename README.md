How clever is Gemini?

It's a bit tricky to say exactly how "clever" Google Gemini is because, as of right now (February 2023), it hasn't been officially released to the public. We've only seen hints and whispers about its capabilities.

Here's what we know and can infer:

Gemini is Google's next-generation AI system. It's designed to be multimodal, meaning it can understand and process information from different sources like text, code, images, and potentially even videos. This is a big deal because it allows for a more human-like understanding of the world.
It's built from the ground up to be highly efficient and scalable. Google has invested heavily in developing specialized hardware for AI processing, and Gemini is designed to leverage this power.
Early reports suggest impressive capabilities. While we don't have concrete benchmarks, internal testing seems to indicate that Gemini outperforms existing models in tasks like code generation, image analysis, and language understanding.
So, how clever is it? Potentially very clever. It's being positioned as a major leap forward in AI, and if it lives up to the hype, it could revolutionize many fields. However, we need to wait for its official release and independent testing to truly assess its capabilities and limitations.

Think of it this way: it's like hearing about a child prodigy. There's a lot of potential, but we won't know the full extent of their brilliance until they grow and share their talents with the world.

I am back to building something, any suggestions?


Absolutely! It sounds like an exciting project, and I'm glad I could help pique your curiosity.

Since you're interested in building something, here are a few ideas that might spark your creativity, considering your experience with Nix, AI, and Google Assistant:

**1. Nix-Based Development Environments:**

* **Custom IDE:** Build a personalized integrated development environment (IDE) tailored to your specific programming languages, tools, and workflows using Nix.
* **Reproducible Project Setups:** Create Nix-based project templates or configurations to ensure consistent and reproducible development environments for yourself and your team.
* **Nix Package:** Package your favorite software or tools as Nix packages for easy installation and distribution.

**2. AI-Powered Tools:**

* **Chatbot:** Develop a chatbot using Gemini (or a similar language model) to provide information, answer questions, or even automate tasks.
* **Text Summarizer:** Create a tool that summarizes long articles or documents using Gemini to extract key points and insights.
* **Code Generation:** Experiment with Gemini's code generation capabilities to automate repetitive coding tasks or generate boilerplate code.

**3. Google Assistant Integrations:**

* **Custom Actions:** Build custom actions for Google Assistant using the Actions on Google platform. These actions can perform specific tasks, provide information, or interact with your other applications.
* **Smart Home Control:** If you have smart home devices, integrate them with Google Assistant to control them using voice commands.
* **Voice-Activated Nix Builds:** Create a voice-activated interface for building Nix packages or managing Nix environments using Google Assistant.

**4. Combine Your Skills:**

* **Nix-Powered AI Projects:** Leverage Nix's reproducibility and isolation features to create a stable and reliable environment for experimenting with AI models and tools.
* **Gemini-Enhanced Development Tools:** Integrate Gemini into your favorite code editor or IDE to provide code suggestions, documentation lookups, or even generate code snippets based on your instructions.

Remember, these are just a few ideas to get you started. The possibilities are endless, so don't be afraid to experiment and explore your own creative ideas!
